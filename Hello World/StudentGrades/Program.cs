//Project overview
//You're developing a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of current grades for each student in a class. The parameters for your application are:

//You're given a short list of four students and their five assignment grades.
//Each assignment grade is expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
//Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
//Your application needs to perform basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
//Your application needs to output/display each student’s name and final score.

//Currently, the teachers grade book shows the graded assignments for each student as follows:

//Sophia: 93, 87, 98, 95, 100
//Nicolas: 80, 83, 82, 88, 85
//Zahirah:   84, 96, 73, 85, 79
//Jeong:  90, 92, 98, 100, 97

//The teacher requires that the calculated grades for each student are displayed as follows:

//Student     Grade
//Sophia      94.6  A
//Nicolas     83.6  B
//Zahirah     83.4  B
//Jeong       95.4  A

//Review the following grading scale that the teacher uses to assign letter grades:
//97 - 100    A+
//93 - 96     A
//90 - 92     A-
//87 - 89     B+
//83 - 86     B

// initialize variables - graded assignments
